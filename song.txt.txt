Bells on bob-tail ring
Making our spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Jingle bells, jingle-jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

I love those jingle bells
Those holiday jingle bells
All those happy jingle be-double-les
I love those jingle bells
Jingle all the wayJingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go
Laughing all the way
